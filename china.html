        <h2> China </h2>
        <section class = "description">
          <p> China was definitely an interesting experience for me. Towards the beginning of my stay there, my brother and I homeschooled because we did not find a suitable English speaking school. This proved to be very difficult. Staying organized and being taught by a teacher that came to our apartment proved to be quite inefficient. I felt like it was too disorganized and so we found a school that was a bit far away. One benefit of homeschooling that I think was really cool was the cultural immersion we had. My brother and I had assignments to go to various museums and cultural landmarks to do reports on them. This was the best way to immerse in the culture and truly learn about what China has to offer.  </p>

        <p> For a school trip, my class and I got to go to Xi'an, China and visit the Terracotta Warriors! This was one of the coolest experiences I had the priveledge of going on. The sheer detail and culture that Xi'an has to offer is amazing. </p>
