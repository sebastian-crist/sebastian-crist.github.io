      <h2> About Me </h2>
      <section class="description">
        <p> I am currently a junior studying at the Univeristy of Miami majoring in Business Technology and Management. My passion for travelling started at a young age when my dad took my brother and I abroad to live in Malta. That was the start of
          a long journey that would slowly grow into an itch to travel. I take advantage of the time off of school during the summer to travel with my family and work abroad to gain unique experiences.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="description2">
        <p> My favorite experience abroad was going to a boarding school in Switzerland in the 7th grade. Not only was Switzerland absolutely stunning, but this experience truly allowed me to grow up and become independent while living away from any
          family. I hope that in my future, I can return to Switzerland and re-walk the grounds that I once lived on.</p>
