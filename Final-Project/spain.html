        <h2> Spain </h2>
        <section class = "description">
          <p> We moved to the Canary Islands during my 4th grade in school. Spain was a challenging country for me to handle because we went to a Spanish speaking school at the time. We had to learn spanish quickly, but it was not very difficult because I used it everyday. The Canary Islands are one of the most beautiful places I have lived. The sunsets were simply mesmerizing. I spent most of my free time outdoors and playing soccer whenever I could. The food was some of the best I have ever eaten. There was a dish called "Escalope" which was a breaded veal with a peppercorn gravy sauce. Every country I have gone to, I have looked for this dish to no avail. To this day, it is one of the best meals I have ever had.  </p>

        <p> Gran Canaria had everything to offer: beautiful weather, amazing food, stunning scenery, and lots to do. Everyday felt like a vacation to me and I never wanted to leave. But sure enough one day, my dad told me to pack my bags because we're moving to Dubai! </p>
